            <h2>What is this?</h2>
            <p>This is <strong><a href="https://github.com/the-shit/music">the-shit/music</a></strong> — a Spotify CLI built on Laravel Zero. It controls your music from the terminal &mdash; play, pause, skip, queue, discover, the whole thing.</p>
            <p>But here's the thing: <strong>every commit must include the Spotify track you were listening to when you wrote the code.</strong></p>
            <p>A git hook auto-injects the currently playing song into your commit message. CI runs a <em>vibe check</em> on every push. No track URL? <strong>Rejected.</strong> No exceptions. Merge commits get a pass because even we aren't that unhinged.</p>
            <p>The result is the <a href="vibes.html">vibes page</a> &mdash; a living soundtrack of the entire codebase, auto-generated after every commit. You're looking at every song that was playing when every line of code was written.</p>
